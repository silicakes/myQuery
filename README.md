myQuery
=======

myQuery(MikeQuery) v.000 is my 1hr attempt to understand the architecture and design behind jQuery. It's written without reading any kind of documentation, while maintaining the same results expected from the original jQuery methods.   Not sure whether this is going somewhere, but i've added some documentation for the various principles implemented.
