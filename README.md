myQuery
=======

myQuery(MikeQuery) is my attempt to understand the architecture and design behind jQuery. 

It's written without reading any kind of documentation, while maintaining the same results expected from the original jQuery methods.

I'm slowly moving from methods i believe are basic, to the ones i think are complex.

Ideally i would run the jQuery test suit and debug my way through the code i make, however for now, 

I'm enjoying hacking it up from scratch.

Not sure whether this is going somewhere, but it might be of use to some curious minds, 

so i'll try keep everything documented inside the source code itself.

enjoy the show,

Michael.
